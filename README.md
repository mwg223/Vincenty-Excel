# Vincenty Direct and Inverse Solution of Geodesics on the Ellipsoid - Excel VBA implementation
**to calculate new coordinate based on azimuth and distance (direct)  
or distance and azimuth based on two coordinates (inverse)**

To make the long story short, I was looking for a way to calculate coordinates, distance and azimuth in Excel.
I checked several available solutions but they were either incomplete, did not work or results were inaccurate.
That is how I ended up developing my own, complete Vincenty Direct and Inverse formulae implementation.

### Implementation
Solution contains 6 functions implementing **Vincenty Direct** and **Vincenty Inverse** formulae as well as 2 functions for Decimal&nbsp;â†”&nbsp;Degrees/Minutes/Seconds format conversion, and uses **WGS84** model.

+ `VincentyDirLat(lat As Double, lon As Double, azimuth As Double, distance As Double) As Variant`  
Calculates geodesic latitude (in degrees) based on one point, bearing (in degrees) and distance (in m) using Vincenty direct formula for ellipsoids
+ `VincentyDirLon(lat As Double, lon As Double, azimuth As Double, distance As Double) As Variant`  
Calculates geodesic longitude (in degrees) based on one point, bearing (in degrees) and distance (in m) using Vincenty direct formula for ellipsoids
+ `VincentyDirRevAzimuth(lat As Double, lon As Double, azimuth As Double, distance As Double) As Variant`  
Calculates geodesic reverse azimuth (in degrees) based on one point, bearing (in degrees) and distance (in m) using Vincenty direct formula for ellipsoids
+ `VincentyInvDistance(lat1 As Double, lon1 As Double, lat2 As Double, lon2 As Double) As Variant`  
Calculates geodesic distance (in m) between two points specified by latitude/longitude (in numeric degrees) using Vincenty inverse formula for ellipsoids
+ `VincentyInvFwdAzimuth(lat1 As Double, lon1 As Double, lat2 As Double, lon2 As Double) As Variant`  
Calculates geodesic azimuth (in degrees) between two points specified by latitude/longitude (in numeric degrees) using Vincenty inverse formula for ellipsoids
+ `VincentyInvRevAzimuth(lat1 As Double, lon1 As Double, lat2 As Double, lon2 As Double) As Variant`  
Calculates geodesic reverse azimuth (in degrees) between two points specified by latitude/longitude (in numeric degrees) using Vincenty inverse formula for ellipsoids
+ `ConvertDegrees(decimalDeg As Double) As String`  
Converts decimal latitude, longitude or azimuth value to degrees/minutes/seconds string format
+ `ConvertDecimal(degreeDeg As String) As Variant`  
Converts latitude, longitude or azimuth string in degrees/minutes/seconds format to decimal value
